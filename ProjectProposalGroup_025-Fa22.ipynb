    "We would like to analyze the relationship between the rental prices of areas around the UC’s and the increase in their new enrollees from 2010-2021. Previously, we have not necessarily done any work relating to the topic but have heard a lot about both the housing crisis in college areas as well as the rising admission rates. These topics obviously are meaningful to us as college students who have had to deal with the ongoing housing and campus overpopulation crisis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us have heard that for this academic year, the UC’s admitted a record amount of undergraduates, especially from instate[^weissman], and this does not come without consequence. Since the UC campuses are limited in space and resources, it is not feasible for them to house all the students they admit on campus. Markedly, we have seen this effect UCSD’s housing policies as they recently decided to end their guarantee on second-year housing[^gaeta-munoz]. Further, we have seen from the news that the waves of new admissions have created housing crises in the surrounding areas, like what happened in Berkeley[^kamm]. Most of this so far has been motivated by our inferences based on the news we have heard about admissions and housing, but doing a bit of light research has shown us that previous research on this topic has shown there to be a positive correlation between the presence of a college in a town and the rental housing prices[^vandergrift].\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze this kind of topic we would need to look at the enrollment numbers of the UC’s and the housing prices of the areas around them, and see if they have changed in a meaningful way in relation to each other. We would have to take into consideration some other important factors such as inflation as well as the general population increase of these areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the UCs have increased their admissions over the past 10 years the areas surrounding have had an influx of students searching for housing off-campus, affecting the demand for housing. Rental market prices are determined by the demand for housing, specifically, an increase in demand should correlate to an increase in price, and so the presence of a highly populated college such as the UCs in an area should likely increase demand and thus housing prices. Alternatively, a hypothetical increase in housing prices over the past 10 years could be attributed to things such as an increase in median household income. "

Furthermore, the data we gathered was solely used for demographics/admissions purposes and does not compromise personal identifying information of any applicants. The University of California is highly reputable/reliable, therefore, we believe our dataset is not going to be underrepresented. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ethical concern that can arise during analysis is using selectivity of the University of California system. Schools with higher rankings and status (such as the UCs)  are typically located in higher income areas, which could bias our data towards more expensive cities and disregard the majority. Although this is not an established causation, more selective/well known schools have an admission of students from higher income families due to opportunity. With this being addressed, we will consider cities/colleges outside of the University of California system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential concern with our research would be the rankings of the UCs with their annual tuition and gross median household income. Since the UCs are located in areas that attract a lot of traffic (Berkeley, Santa Barbara, La Jolla, etc.,) , they are bound to have an inflated economy compared to the cities that California State schools might be located in. This could result in the majority of people who do not attend UCs to be underrepresented. However, we will combat this by trying our best to consider any biases or discrimination in our dataset. We hope to provide a fair anaylsis that could not be misconstrude and discriminate towards any particular group of people. Regardless of the result, we hope to provide an impartial analysis on our findings.\n",

All of the data we gathered is of free public use and we guarantee that our data will consider the privacy of everyone. We will prevent any leakage of information that reveals the identity of certain individuals. \n"
